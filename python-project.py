#This program is going to be a interactive questionaire to determine whether a person is going to make the right choice when it comes to drinking and driving
#A function is going to be created in order to get this interactive game going, and a dictionary is also going to be made for this case
#Based off the answers they give to the questions they answer, it will determine if they are going to make the right choice or not. Using the data from this sheet to determine if they know the  rules  to driving while intoxicated
#Using a boolean, if more than half the results are true then they are making a good decision, but if half are false, then they are making a bad descion
#Mostly the question would consist of True or false questions with some multiple choice so the end can be determined.
#After they do the quiz, there is going to be a visual at the end to show the amount of accidents happen and the deaths the resulted
