You have really detailed and thoughtful comments here, which is the primary goal of this milestone, so great job. I don't yet understand how the function you're creating is going to be used: where is it called and what is the argument "deaths" going to be. I don't see it used anywhere in your code. You also need to account for wrong or nonsense answers, but I imagine that's going to come as part of adding the content of the piece. Let's talk in person about the overall architecture of this piece: I'm not sure that the way you're currently setting it up with this big function is the way to structure the whole thing. (Note that I wrote these comments and THEN GitHub Desktop showed me there was a new version available, so some of my comments about content are obviously irrelevant now, but my concerns about the structure and function are still valid.)
