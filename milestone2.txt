Your code initially didn't run because of a character encoding issue, but once I put the correct header on your file there was no issue, so I'm not going to dock you for that since it's an issue outside the scope of your code. Note that I did push out the file with the correct encoding. Other than that, your code ran correctly. I would encourage you to add the correct answers to the project at some point, so the user can see which ones they got wrong. It's hardly an educational opportunity otherwise. What you have here is great, and you've done well to keep your code DRY. I would encourage you now to expand this: can you add more questions, for example? With a week left, what can you do to make this an even better experience for your user?
